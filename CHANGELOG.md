# Changelog

All notable changes to the Alibaba Blueteam project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.2] — 2026-07-08

### Added

#### Alibaba Cloud Env Var Auto-Discovery
- **`_discover_aliyun_env()` in `config.py`** — Auto-discovers `ALIBABA_REGION`, `ALIBABA_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `ALIBABA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` from `aliyun configure` and `~/.aliyun/config.json` at module import time. Populates `os.environ` so `run_command` subprocesses inherit these values without requiring them in `.env`. Region auto-discovered via `aliyun configure get region`; credentials read from the current profile in `~/.aliyun/config.json`.

#### TUI Progress Log Plugin
- **`tui_result_capture_plugin`** — New ConnectOnion `after_each_tool` plugin that pushes tool results to the `ProgressLog` widget in the TUI. Uses module-level `_tui_app` reference set at TUI startup; gracefully no-ops in prompt/daemon modes.

### Changed

#### Plugin Architecture Refactor
- **Inline handler → proper plugin** — Moved `_capture_tool_result` from a 34-line inline handler in `blueteam.py` (registered via private `agent._register_event()`) to a proper `@after_each_tool` plugin in `plugins.py`. Registers via standard `plugins=[...]` in `_create_agent()`. Removes private API dependency.
- **Shared trace helper** — Consolidated duplicate trace traversal logic shared by `compliance_logger` and `capture_tool_result` into `_get_last_tool_result(agent)`. Eliminates ~26 lines of redundant code and enforces consistent field name usage (`tool_name` with `name` fallback).
- **Plugin execution order** — `tui_result_capture` now runs BEFORE `compliance_logger` so the ProgressLog sees raw tool results (before `[TOOL OUTPUT START]`/`[TOOL OUTPUT END]` wrappers are applied for LLM context).
- **Plugin count: 2 → 3** (hitl_approval, tui_result_capture, compliance_logger).

#### TUI Rendering Fix
- **MarkupError resolved** — Set `_render_markup = False` in `ProgressLog` widget to prevent Rich from parsing square brackets in tool results as markup tags. Was causing `MarkupError: Expected markup value` crashes during layout refresh.

### Removed

#### Dart SDK References
- **`blueteam-autopilot-prep/SKILL.md`** — Removed Dart SDK ≥ 3.4 from prerequisite table and optional tool list (no Dart runtime exists in this project).
- **`alibaba-security-ops/SKILL.md`** — Removed all Dart migration history: "Replaces Dart MCP tool" tags, Dart Original descriptions, Key Differences comparison table, and Don't-use-when section referencing Dart.

---

## [3.0.1] — 2026-07-06

### Added

#### End-to-End Testing Regime
- **`tests/e2e/`** — Comprehensive real-mode testing suite covering all 5 workflows, cross-cutting features, and daemon mode.
- **`deliver-attacks.sh`** — Sample attack delivery via curl (SQLi, XSS, LFI, command injection, scanner behavior, SSRF) targeting WAF-protected domains.
- **`test-workflows.sh`** — Per-workflow validation for incident-response, iam-forensic, threat-hunt, compliance-audit, and continuous-monitor.
- **`test-cross-cutting.sh`** — Embedding search, HITL gating, monitor persistence, DB schema validation, IAM drift detection.
- **`test-daemon.sh`** — Daemon mode startup, attack detection, graceful shutdown verification.
- **`run-all-tests.sh`** — Orchestrator with prerequisite validation and phase-based execution.

### Fixed

#### WAF Attack Delivery
- **HTTP-level rule triggering** — Switched from HTTPS to HTTP to bypass SSL-level connection resets and generate actual WAF log events (HTTP 405 responses).
- **Curl error handling** — Added graceful handling of connection resets (exit code 35) to correctly identify WAF blocking.
- **Attack payload tuning** — Updated payloads to use standard signatures (UNION-based SQLi, script tag XSS, double-encoding LFI) that trigger WAF detection rules.

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added

#### Multi-Agent Workflow Engine
- **`workflows/_engine/`** — Declarative workflow orchestration engine (parser.py, runner.py, context.py). Parses WORKFLOW.md files with YAML frontmatter defining phases, creates scoped Agent instances per phase with restricted tool sets and phase-specific system prompts, and accumulates outputs via WorkflowContext.
- **`workflows/incident-response/WORKFLOW.md`** — 5-phase reactive incident handling (discovery → deep_dive → recommendation → action → report). Migrated all 5+2 behaviors from the monolithic system prompt into declarative workflow phases.
- **`workflows/iam-forensic/WORKFLOW.md`** — 4-phase IAM security audit (discovery → analysis → remediation → persist) with 13 IAM tools and credential risk scoring.
- **`workflows/threat-hunt/WORKFLOW.md`** — 4-phase proactive threat hunting (collect → analyze → correlate → report) with external correlation and pattern analysis.
- **`workflows/compliance-audit/WORKFLOW.md`** — 4-phase compliance gap analysis (inventory → map → evidence → report) with control mapping and evidence collection.
- **`workflows/continuous-monitor/WORKFLOW.md`** — 3-phase autonomous SOC monitoring (scan → triage → escalate) driven by the daemon loop.
- **Auto-delegation** — Main agent auto-delegates to workflows for investigations while handling quick single-tool queries directly.

#### Vector Embeddings for Similarity Search
- **`connectonion_qwen/embeddings.py`** — Universal incident embeddings using DashScope text-embedding-v3 (1024-dim in real mode, 64-dim deterministic hash fallback in demo mode). Cosine similarity search against all stored embeddings.
- **`connectonion_qwen/memory.py`** — Persistent SQLite/libSQL database (`data/blueteam.db`) with `incident_embeddings` table for vector storage and `monitor_state` table for daemon state tracking.
- **`search_similar_incidents`** tool — Query institutional memory for previously seen incidents similar to the current investigation. Returns top-k matches with similarity scores.
- **`store_incident_memory`** tool — Store incident descriptions as embeddings for future similarity search. All 5 workflows auto-store findings.

#### Autonomous SOC Daemon
- **`--daemon` / `-d` CLI flag** — Run as continuous monitoring daemon. Polls on configurable interval, auto-triages new alerts, escalates high-severity findings.
- **`--interval` / `-i` CLI flag** — Monitoring interval in seconds (default: 60). Daemon sleeps between ticks with graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown.
- **`get_monitor_state`** / **`update_monitor_state`** tools — Track last check timestamp, tick count, and escalation count in the database.
- **Rich console output** — CRITICAL/HIGH escalations highlighted in red, all-clear in green, with per-tick timestamps and shutdown summary.

### Changed

#### System Prompt Refactoring
- **`connectonion_qwen/system_prompt.py`** — Slimmed from 188 lines to ~88 lines (53% reduction). Monolithic behavior definitions replaced with auto-delegation rules that route to the appropriate workflow. Identity, compliance context, and guardrails preserved.

#### Tool Count
- **37 tools** (up from 19): 13 IAM forensic tools, 2 workflow engine tools, 2 vector memory tools, 2 monitoring tools, plus original 18 security tools.

#### Documentation
- **`blueteam.py`** — Welcome banner version updated to v3.0.0
- **`.env.example`** — Added Memory & Embeddings section and Autonomous SOC daemon section
- **`submission/about.md`** — Updated with workflow engine, embeddings, daemon mode, and autonomous SOC capabilities

---

## [2.2.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added

#### Demo Mode Timestamp Rewriting
- **`_rewrite-timestamps.sh`** — Shared helper script that rewrites fixture timestamps relative to "now" at runtime, preserving chronological spacing between events while making demo data appear fresh
- **`list-events.sh`** — Demo mode now pipes fixture through `rewrite_timestamps` function before returning
- **`list-waf-events.sh`** — Same timestamp rewriting applied to WAF event fixtures
- Timestamp fields handled: `createdAt`, `timestamp`, `detectedAt`, `updatedAt`

### Fixed

#### Secure Coding Audit Fixes
- **`connectonion_qwen/tools.py`** — Generic exception handler now logs detail server-side and returns sanitized "Tool execution failed. Please retry." message to LLM (prevents information leakage)
- **`connectonion_qwen/tools.py`** — `block_waf_ips` now validates IP/CIDR inputs using Python's `ipaddress` module before passing to script (prevents malformed input to state-changing tool)
- **`connectonion_qwen/mcp.py`** — MCP tool failures log detail server-side, return "MCP tool execution failed. Please retry." (prevents internal error exposure)
- **`connectonion_qwen/qwen_llm.py`** — Qwen Cloud API errors log detail server-side, return "Qwen Cloud API error. Check your API key and model configuration." (prevents API key/endpoint leakage)
- **`connectonion_qwen/config.py`** — `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` int parse wrapped in try/except, defaults to 20 on invalid env var input (prevents crash on malformed config)

### Changed
- `blueteam.py` — Welcome banner version updated to v2.2.1

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

#### Headless / Cron Mode
- **`--prompt` / `-p` CLI argument** — Run the agent non-interactively with a single prompt, then exit. Ideal for cron jobs, CI pipelines, and automation workflows.
- **Stdin piping** — Pipe prompts via stdin (`echo "Show events" | python blueteam.py`). If both `--prompt` and stdin are provided, they are concatenated with a newline separator.
- **`_run_prompt()`** — Headless execution path: creates agent with `quiet=True` (no TUI, no banner), runs a single prompt, prints response to stdout, and exits cleanly.
- **Graceful error handling** — Headless mode catches exceptions and prints clean error messages to stderr with non-zero exit code (no raw tracebacks).

#### Configurable API Endpoint
- **`QWEN_BASE_URL` env var** — Override the DashScope API base URL via `.env`. Defaults to the international endpoint (`https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`). Supports mainland China endpoint and custom gateways.
- **.env.example** — Documented `QWEN_BASE_URL` option with examples for both international and mainland China endpoints.

### Changed
- `blueteam.py` — Welcome banner version updated to v2.2.0
- `connectonion_qwen/config.py` — `QWEN_BASE_URL` now reads from environment variable with default fallback (previously hardcoded)

---

## [2.1.4] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed

#### MCP Server Loading (ClientSession lifecycle)
- **`connectonion_qwen/mcp.py`** — Fixed MCP servers failing to load at startup (0 tools registered, empty `/mcp` status, 60s overall timeout). Root cause: `ClientSession` was constructed without entering its async context manager, so `__aenter__` never started the `_receive_loop` that routes server responses to per-request streams. `initialize()` hung waiting for a response that was never delivered, until the async bridge's 60s overall cap cancelled everything — producing a `BrokenResourceError` cascade and leaving `_server_status` empty. Verified against `.mcp.json` (ciso-assistant: 101 tools, alibabacloud-mcp-server: 26 tools — both now connect cleanly).
- **Session lifecycle** — `ClientSession` is now entered via `__aenter__()` after creation (starts the receive loop) and kept alive in `_sessions` for the agent's lifetime so later tool calls reuse the live connection.
- **`shutdown_mcp()`** — Now exits each `ClientSession` (`__aexit__`) before closing the stdio transports that back them, cancelling their receive loops cleanly on quit.

### Changed
- `agent.py` — TUI welcome banner version set to v2.1.4
- README.md — Slash Commands feature row updated to include `/mcp` (MCP server connection status), which was already registered in `agent.py` but missing from the docs

---

## [2.1.3] — 2026-06-30

### Added

#### Incident Response Report Generation Tool
- **`generate_incident_report`** — New tool (19th) that aggregates all investigation data (event detail, alerts, assets, vulnerabilities, WAF, compliance controls) into a structured context package for report synthesis
- **`connectonion_qwen/report_models.py`** — Pydantic models for structured IR report data: `IncidentReport`, `AttackChainStage`, `AffectedAsset`, `TimelineEvent`, `RecommendedAction`, `AuditEntry`
- **Extended schema** — `incident-report.json` updated with `timeline`, `blastRadius`, `confidence`, `recommendedActions`, `rollbackPlan`, and `auditTrail` fields
- **Extended template** — `incident-report.md` updated with Blast Radius, Investigation Timeline, Confidence Rating, Recommended Actions, Rollback Plan, and Audit Trail sections
- **System prompt** — Added Behavior 5b protocol instructing the agent to use `generate_incident_report` for comprehensive IR reports with compliance mapping and executive summary

### Changed
- `connectonion_qwen/tools.py` — Added `generate_incident_report` to `ALL_TOOLS` (now 19 tools); added `_safe_parse` helper for JSON parsing
- `agent.py` — Version bumped to v2.3.0

---

## [2.1.2] — 2026-06-30

### Added

#### MCP Server Integration
- **`connectonion_qwen/mcp.py`** — MCP client bridge that connects to external MCP servers, discovers tools, and wraps them as ConnectOnion-compatible Python functions
- **`.mcp.json`** — Default MCP server config with CISO Assistant (stdio) and Vanta (SSE) presets
- **Async bridge** — Background event loop thread bridges sync ConnectOnion tools to async MCP SDK, with 10s per-server connection timeout
- **Dynamic tool wrapping** — MCP tool schemas (JSON Schema) auto-converted to Python type hints + signatures for ConnectOnion's tool_factory
- **Graceful degradation** — Unreachable MCP servers are skipped with warnings; existing knowledge documents serve as fallback
- **`MCP_CONFIG_PATH`** — New env var / config option to override `.mcp.json` path
- **`mcp>=1.27,<2`** — Official MCP Python SDK added to dependencies

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` — Added `mcp>=1.27,<2`
- `agent.py` — Loads MCP tools at startup and appends to built-in tools; cleans up on exit
- `.env.example` — Added MCP configuration section

---

## [2.1.1] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed

#### Agent WAF Fallback for Basic Edition
- **System prompt** — Added Basic/Advanced edition fallback instructions: when `list_security_events` returns 0 events, the agent now automatically queries WAF logs via `list_waf_security_events`, `list_waf_top_rules`, and `list_waf_top_ips`
- **list-events.sh** — Added WAF fallback hint when Security Center returns 0 events; suppressed human-readable headers in agent mode (`AGENT_MODE=1`)

#### WAF CLI Parameter Naming
- **list-waf-top-rules.sh** — Fixed `--InstanceId` → `--instance-id`, `--StartTimestamp` → `--start-timestamp`, `--EndTimestamp` → `--end-timestamp` (WAF CLI requires lowercase-hyphenated params)
- **list-waf-top-ips.sh** — Same parameter naming fix as above

#### Script Output Parsing
- **list-waf-top-rules.sh** — Changed from human-readable text to structured JSON output; fixed `HitCount` → `Count` field name to match actual API response; resolved bash double-quote conflicts by using single-quoted Python
- **list-waf-top-ips.sh** — Same JSON output fix and quote conflict resolution
- **tools.py** — Added `AGENT_MODE=1` environment variable to suppress human-readable script headers when agent calls tools, ensuring clean JSON output for LLM parsing

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added

#### ConnectOnion Framework Integration
- **ConnectOnion adoption** — Migrated from custom agent loop to the [ConnectOnion](https://github.com/openonion/connectonion) agent framework (v1.0.4) for full agent runtime, plugin system, and Textual TUI
- **`agent.py`** — Single entry point (`python agent.py`) wiring QwenCloudLLM + Agent + Chat TUI with slash commands (`/help`, `/clear`, `/model`, `/quit`)

- Fixed `list-response-policies.sh` to use correct product `cloud-siem` with API version `2022-06-16` and PascalCase parameters (`--PageSize`, `--CurrentPage`)
- Fixed `execute-response-policy.sh` to use `UpdateAutomateResponseConfigStatus` (the actual API for enabling response rules)
- Updated ops SKILL.md with Enterprise edition requirement note for response policy APIs

#### Documentation
- README.md: Updated skill count (6 → 7), added compat skill to directory tree and skill summary table
- medium-article.md: Updated fixture count (14 → 15), removed `ALIBABA_REGION` from `.env` example
